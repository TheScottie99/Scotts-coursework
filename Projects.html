          <h4>Arduino RC Car!</h4>
          <p>One of my projects I created an RC car which is controlled through Arduino and processing.
          I was able to program the arduino board to receive information through processing which was
          how I managed to use a keyboard to control the motors as well as the horn. The way that
          processing works is that it receives an input from the user and then it sends that information
          to arduino so that arduino can do something with that input e.g. processing receives the
          input 'w' and then sends that to arduino that makes one of the motors run in a certain
          direction. I also managed to program some LED's which turned on once the light level got
          below a certain level therefore they acted as headlights for the RC Car. Finally I also
          connected my phone to processing and secured it to the car so that when I am driving the RC
          car I will be able to see where the car is going from my computer screen.</p>

          <h4>Raspberry Pi Games!</h4>
          <p>Another project that I have done was creating several different games which could be played
          on a Raspberry Pi. I coded all of the games using python, specifically the pygame module
          and it only took me a few days to create a couple of simple games. One the games I created
          using pygame was the classic, Snake! I was able to code every aspect of the game correctly
          with only minor setbacks which included when the snake hit the wall it would sometimes
          say game over but other times it would continue on playing. But it is now a functioning
          game which can be used on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

          <h4>Website For Holiday Makers!</h4>
          <p>I also created a website which allows customers to find out more information about their
          chosen destination and hotel to see if they want to go there on holiday. I also able to code
          all the different pages successfully and I also had a login system so that the user can create
          an account which can be logged into later on which saves your progress as you compare places.
          I also had a google maps window which showed the user exactly where they are looking so that
          they know if it's in the prime location. Finally I also had a feedback page where the user
          could leave me feedback on what to improve on my website so that it is more accessible
          for all users.</p>
